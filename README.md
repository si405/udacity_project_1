# Udacity Nanodegree Project 1

# Run the file simons_movies.py to create the web page that shows two of my favorite movies.
# Click on one of the movies listed to see the trailer for that movie.

# The file simons_movie.py creates the movie instances by using omdbapi.com to access movie
# information. It then calls the fresh_tomatoes function to render the web page and list the
# movies.

# The file media.py contains the class definitions for the movie.
